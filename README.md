## ‚ú® Highlights

| üî¢ **Topic**                  | üí° **Description**                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Introduction**           | Covers Java basics: syntax, data types, variables, operators, and simple I/O.                                               |
| **2. String and Character**   | Explores string manipulation, character operations, and common methods like `charAt()`, `substring()`, and `toCharArray()`. |
| **3. Class, Object, Methods** | Demonstrates how to define classes, create objects, and structure reusable methods in Java.                                 |
| **4. Encapsulation**          | Focuses on data protection using private fields, constructors, and getter/setter methods.                                   |
| **5. Inheritance**            | Introduces class hierarchies, code reuse, and the use of `extends` and `super`.                                             |
| **6. Abstraction**            | Explains abstract classes/interfaces and hiding complexity.                                                                 |
| **7. Polymorphism**           | Demonstrates method overriding and dynamic dispatch in Java.                                                                |
| **8. GUI Programming**        | Shows simple Java GUI apps using Swing/JOptionPane.                                                                         |
| **9. Error and Exception**    | Covers exception handling, try-catch, and Java error types.                                                                 |
| **10. Collections**           | Introduces Java Collection Framework such as List, Set, and Map.                                                            |

## üöÄ Getting Started

To try out the programs:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhuriphatiZAMU/OOP-2.1-2025.git
   ```

2. Open it using any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)

3. Navigate to the `src/` folder and run the desired `.java` file.

> Most files include a `main` method, making them runnable as standalone examples.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

Through hands-on practice in this project, I developed:

- ‚úÖ Stronger understanding of OOP and Java syntax  
- ‚úÖ The ability to break problems into modular methods  
- ‚úÖ Confidence in using arrays and string handling techniques  
- ‚úÖ Experience building small GUI apps with `JOptionPane`  
- ‚úÖ An appreciation for clean code and readability
