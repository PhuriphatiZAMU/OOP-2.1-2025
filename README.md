| üî¢ **Topic**                  | üí° **Description**                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Introduction**           | Covers Java basics: syntax, data types, variables, operators, and simple I/O.                                               |
| **2. String and Character**   | Explores string manipulation, character operations, and common methods like `charAt()`, `substring()`, and `toCharArray()`. |
| **3. Class, Object, Methods** | Demonstrates how to define classes, create objects, and structure reusable methods in Java.                                 |
| **4. Encapsulation**          | Focuses on data protection using private fields, constructors, and getter/setter methods.                                   |
| **5. Inheritance**            | Introduces class hierarchies, code reuse, and the use of `extends` and `super`.                                             |
| **6. Abstraction**            | Explains abstract classes/interfaces and hiding complexity.                                                                 |
| **7. Polymorphism**           | Demonstrates method overriding and dynamic dispatch in Java.                                                                |
| **8. GUI Programming**        | Shows simple Java GUI apps using Swing/JOptionPane.                                                                         |
| **9. Error and Exception**    | Covers exception handling, try-catch, and Java error types.                                                                 |
| **10. Collections**           | Introduces Java Collection Framework such as List, Set, and Map.                                                            |
